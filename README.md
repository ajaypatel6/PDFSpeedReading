# PDFSpeedReading
This is a desktop application that allows you to select a range of pages that you have completely read, the time you have read for and calculate the words per minutes

# adding
- currently looking into matplotlib to visualize the data

# Limitations
PDF files work ONLY if the text within them are normal. This means no artistic/odd looking styles that are custom made or perhaps the author wrote it by hand or something like that
