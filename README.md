# PDFSpeedReading
This is a desktop application that allows you to select a range of pages that you have completely read, the time you have read for and calculate the words per minutes.

You can view your WPM history across all the different books you have read

# visualize
Using matplotlib to see your progress

The wpm history is saved as "speed_wpm.txt", and the graph is based on that file

If you choose to delete a recording, you simply delete it in the text file

# Limitations
PDF files work ONLY if the text within them are normal. This means no artistic/odd looking styles that are custom made or perhaps the author wrote it by hand or something like that

# what to add in the future
Proper error msg lol
Better visualization
Comparison between users
Book specific history
Different data visualization options
bar chart/ plot chart options
